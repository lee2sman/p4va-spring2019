# Interactivity and Games

So far we have taken an expansive view within the context of programming for visual artists. We have studied a history of computers and programming, historical precedents of fluxus, instructions art and algorithmic art. We have looked at example works by contemporary artists creating interactive works and artworks made for the web. 

Now we are going to expand our context and consider video games within this context, and we will contrast it to other media and approaches.

Famously, Roger Ebert has stated clearly that [video games can never be art](https://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/video-games-can-never-be-art). Where are his thoughts correct? Where do they miss the mark?

Why then consider games within the context of this course Programming For Visual Arts?

Much like film and theater, games are a form that encompass a range of elements that come together to create a complete work of art. These include acting/dialogue, narrative, sound design, visual design, conceptual thinking and technical skills.

Games encompass these elements and also adds in interactivity. The choices presented in video games can be meaningful or overly simplistic. Games as a genre is quite wide - including simple puzzle challenges like Tetris or Flappy Bird to extensive 3d meta-narratives like opera in games like Kentucky Route Zero or Journey.

Today we will start small and modestly, building out a game, keeping in mind aesthetic, technical and conceptual modes of thinking.
