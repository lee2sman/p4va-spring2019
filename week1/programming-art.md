Most artists working with computers were engineers and scientists because computers were generally in scientific research labs.

### Bell Labs

Bell Labs was an early supporter of artists experimenting and working with technology. These include Claude Shannon, Ken Knowlton, Leon Harmon, Lillian Schwartz, Charles Csuri, A. Michael Noll, Edward Zajec, and Billy Klüver, an engineer who also collaborated with Robert Rauschenberg to form Experiments in Art and Technology (EAT) at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

Bell Labs supported artists to work with their computers after hours. They supported '9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering' organised by EAT in 1966. 10 contemporary artists worked with engineers and scientists from Bell Labs to host performances using new technology.

Michael Noll was invited to work at Bell Telephone Laboratories in New Jersey in 1962. He attempted to imitate paints by Piet Mondrian, Bridget Riley and others.

Early computers did not necessarily have displays. One common output was a plotter, which used vector coordinates to direct a drawing pen.

In 1968, the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London hosted one of the most influential early exhibitions of computer art called Cybernetic Serendipity. The exhibition included many of whom often regarded as the first digital artists, Nam June Paik, Frieder Nake, Leslie Mezei, Georg Nees, A. Michael Noll, John Whitney, and Charles Csuri.

### 1980s

In the 1980s computers came into the home. Artists began having access to graphical systems.
