# Final Project 

Our assignments so far have been fairly restrictive. For your final project, I want to open up the field for you to create an artwork of your choice. The project should use skills and tools we developed this semester. You donâ€™t need to use p5.js if there is another library or language that you prefer. 

Final Project and presentations/critiques due Friday May 10

So far in this course we have covered:

* variables
* arrays
* the debugging process
* functions
* classes and objects
* loops
* conditionals
* working with the web as platform 
* history of artists working with programming and creating their own tools
* history of procedural and algorithmic art
* how math and computation can be used in the creation of works of art and design
* cultural, political and social issues inherent in computation and addressed in the work of new media artists

Consider these elements in the creation of your own work for the final project.
  
## Your final project should have a separate document with the following info

1. Final Project title
2. 1-3 sentence description
3. What was your approach or strategy did you take in creating your project?
4. What frameworks, libraries, did you use, if any?
5. What other artists, projects or artworks did you research that led to the creation of this work?
6. Include at least 2 screenshots of your project running.


Your code should:

- be clear and organized
- use comments to make sections and particular parts of your code clear
- work without bugs
- work properly in fullscreen

Your final project should:

- Be a compelling and interesting artwork made with code
- Properly cite any code that you found and used online
- Create a compelling interactive visual artwork synthesizing both concept and technical execution
